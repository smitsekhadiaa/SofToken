# üóÑÔ∏è SofToken


## Secure & Efficient solution for Software Licensing and Royalty using NFTs
SofToken is a blockchain-based application that allows users to Mint a NFT for their software and apply a license on it. Other users have a option to subscribe to the minted NFT and use it to build their own software. Different types of restrictions can be applied to the usage of a software before it is minted.

- User creates his/her profile. The details are stored on IPFS & Polybase.
- User can Follow other people.
- User can mint NFT for his software having a option on which type of NFT he/she wants to mint.
- 3 ways to Mint NFT :-

    - proprierty executable : 
        - Only the executable file of the software minted (NFT A) is shared with User 2
        - User 2 cannot mint his own NFT B using NFT software A.
     
    - Reusable & Modifiable (without Royalty):
        - Code files are shared with the user
        - User can mint his own NFT B using the software as a dependent NFT A.
        - None of the total amount User 2 receives from his subscribers is given to User 1.

    - Reusable & Modifiable (With Royalty):
        - Code files are shared with the user
        - User can mint his own NFT B using the software as a dependent NFT A.
        - 10% of the total amount User 2 receives from his subscribers is given to User 1 as royalty fee.
- User can Filter out NFT Softwares based on Price, Ratings etc.
- User can give his own rating to the software.
- Live Price of the NFT is determined by the Ratings it gets.
    - The rating is passed through Aggregator function which calculates the price of the NFT off the chain. (No gas consumed)
- User can subscribe to the NFT software. After subscription, user can download ZIP files for the software.
- Once subscribed user can :-
    - chat with the owner of the NFT software.
    - Group chat with other subscribers to the same NFT software.
    - Notifications are sent to the user on receiving messages.
